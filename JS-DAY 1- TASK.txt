Q. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.

A. HTTP/1.1 processes one request at a time over a connection, causing delays. HTTP/2 supports concurrent requests using multiplexing, 
compresses headers, allows server push, and prioritizes streams, resulting in quicker page loads and improved efficiency.

Q. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

A. Objects are a fundamental construct in JavaScript, acting as containers for key-value pairs that facilitate the organization and storage of data. 
Beneath their surface, understanding how objects are internally represented is crucial for efficient programming. 
In JavaScript, objects are essentially dynamic collections of properties and methods. 
These properties can be primitive values, other objects, or functions. 
The internal representation of objects involves a combination of hash maps and prototypes. Hash maps allow quick access to properties, 
while prototypes enable inheritance and the sharing of properties and methods between objects.

JavaScript's flexible nature allows developers to add, modify, or delete properties at runtime. This dynamic feature, while powerful, 
demands careful consideration to manage memory efficiently and avoid unintended side effects. When working with objects, understanding their internal representation empowers developers to optimize code performance and maintain clean,
organized data structures.
